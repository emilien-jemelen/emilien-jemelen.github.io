## About

I am a Ph.D candidate in the [HeKa](https://heka.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) Inria team hosted at [PariSanté Campus](https://parisantecampus.fr/), under the supervision of Sandrine Katsahian and Agathe Guilloux. Here is [a short CV](/CV_Emilien_Jemelen.pdf).

I am interested in statistics and Machine Learning—from detection and risk prediction with convolutional networks (deep learning) to making models more trustworthy to the user, with a focus on X-ray imaging medical applications.
