## About

I am a Ph.D candidate in the [HeKa](https://heka.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) Inria team hosted at [PariSanté Campus](https://parisantecampus.fr/), under the supervision of [Sandrine Katsahian](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sandrine-Katsahian) and [Agathe Guilloux](https://sites.google.com/view/agatheguilloux-personalwebsite). Here is [a short CV](/CV_Emilien_Jemelen.pdf).

My primary research interests lie in statistics and machine learning, with a particular focus on medical imaging applications. In light of the limited interpretability of neural networks, I am especially interested in developing models augmented with application-wise abstention mechanisms (Selective Prediction) that provide performance guarantees and enhance the transparency and reliability of model outputs for end users.

**Contact:**

* E-mail: name.surname@inria.fr

* Long-standing practice of classical guitar, with formal training in the flamenco repertoire and a growing interest in Baroque counterpoint
* A sustained interest in natural phenomena, such as plant communication (e.g. the fascinating documentary of [Freddie Röckenhaus and Petra Höfer](https://www.senscritique.com/film/le_murmure_de_la_foret_quand_les_arbres_parlent/44263907)), collective dynamics in animal groups (well illustrated by [the popularized explanations of Fouloscopie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch7VxxTBe1c)), and climate evolution and temperature reconstruction, notably presented in the [lectures of Edouard Bard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F49vKJFuGlU) at Collège de France
